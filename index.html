                <strong> Season 2011/12 </strong> <br>
                <small class="bottom-margin"> After making his debut, two seasons prior, Zaha was becoming a regular in the Crystal Palace team and started the season off with two goals against Crawley town. Furthermore, Zaha was a key member of the Crystal Palace that reached the league-cup semi-finals, particularly impressing in Crystal Palace's shock win over then Premier League Champions Manchester United at Old Trafford that really put him on people's lips. To end off an impressive season, he was voted the Football League's Young Player of the Year.</small>
                
                <strong> Season 2012/13</strong> <br>
                <small class="bottom-margin"> After Zaha secured his big money transfer to Manchester United in January 2013, he returned to Crystal Palace on loan as part of the deal for the remainder of the 2012/13 season. He played a pivotal role in Crystal Palace's promotion to the Premier League. Scored twice in the play-off semi-final second leg vs arch-rivals Brighton. Furthermore, Zaha won the penalty that led to Kevin Philipps scoring the resulting winner from the spot in the play-off final vs Watford at Wembley.</small>
                
                <strong> Season 2016/17 </strong> <br>
                <small class="bottom-margin"> After narrowly losing the FA Cup Final in extra-time to Manchester United, Zaha really took to centre stage and firmly placed his position as the talisman at Crystal Palace. Zaha starred in famous wins over Arsenal and Chelsea, bagging a goal and assit as they came from behind to win at Stamford Bridge. Later on in the season Zaha scored the opening goal in the demolition of Hull City that secured Crystal Palace's top flight status in the Premier League for another season.</small>
                
                <strong> Season 2017/18 </strong> <br>
                <small class="bottom-margin"> Arguably his best ever season, Zaha once again became the key player for Crystal Palace scoring the winner against Chelsea after Crystal Palace had lost their first 7 games without scoring a goal. Zaha also came to centre stage again as he scored two goals in the 3-2 win over arch-nemesis Brighton, as well as scoring sublime goals against Bournemouth and Leicester respectively. Zaha's influence was clear to see as it became apparent that Crystal Palace could not win games without the attacker. After this stimulating season, Zaha once again won the Crystal Palace player of the year award for the third season running and was awarded with a new lucrative 5 year contract.</small>
